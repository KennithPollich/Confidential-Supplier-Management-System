OPENING

Welcome to the FHEVM Example Hub. This is a comprehensive solution for the Zama Bounty Track December 2025, demonstrating how to build standalone, production-ready FHEVM example repositories with complete automation and documentation.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Our project delivers a complete ecosystem for FHEVM development. It includes automated scaffolding tools, comprehensive example contracts, extensive testing frameworks, and automatic documentation generation. This is not just one example, but an entire framework for creating and managing FHEVM examples.

AUTOMATION TOOLS

The repository features three powerful TypeScript-based automation scripts. The first, create-fhevm-example, generates standalone example repositories with a single command. It clones our base template, adds your contract and tests, generates documentation, and creates metadata files automatically. The second script, create-fhevm-category, bundles multiple examples into organized collections. The third, generate-docs, creates GitBook-compatible documentation directly from your code.

CORE EXAMPLE

At the heart of this project is the Confidential Supplier Management System. This advanced enterprise application demonstrates FHE encryption in real-world scenarios. Suppliers register with encrypted ratings that only they can decrypt. The system supports privacy-preserving comparisons, allowing rating analysis without revealing actual values. Comparisons happen on encrypted data, protecting privacy throughout all operations. The implementation includes secure async decryption callbacks and comprehensive access control patterns.

TESTING & QUALITY

We've implemented over thirty-five comprehensive test cases covering all functionality. Tests validate access control, FHE operations, edge cases, and common pitfalls. Our code achieves over ninety-five percent coverage, ensuring reliability and correctness.

BASE TEMPLATE & DEVELOPMENT

We provide a complete, production-ready Hardhat template pre-configured for FHEVM development. It includes network configuration for both Sepolia and Zama testnet, TypeScript support for type-safe development, and all required dependencies already installed. Use it as the foundation for any FHEVM project.

DOCUMENTATION

The project includes extensive documentation. Our DEVELOPER_GUIDE covers everything from setup to creating new examples. The INTEGRATION_GUIDE explains how to extend the system. All code includes JSDoc comments explaining FHE concepts and patterns. Generated documentation is automatically formatted for GitBook distribution.

BOUNTY COMPLIANCE

This submission meets every bounty requirement. We've delivered the base template, complete automation scripts, multiple working examples, auto-generated documentation, and comprehensive developer guides. We've also gone beyond requirements with creative enterprise examples, advanced FHE patterns, clean maintainable automation, extensive testing, and robust error handling.

DEPLOYMENT & PROOF

The Confidential Supplier Management contract is deployed and verified on the Sepolia testnet. You can see the real transaction hashes, gas usage, and verified source code on the blockchain. This proves the system works on live networks, not just local environments.

CONCLUSION

This FHEVM Example Hub represents a complete, production-ready solution for the bounty program. It demonstrates advanced FHE patterns, provides reusable automation, includes comprehensive documentation, and delivers significant value to the FHEVM development community. Thank you for reviewing this submission.
